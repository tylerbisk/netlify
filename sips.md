Sips is the first-ever party game that you can play whenever and wherever. All you need is the app, some friends, and the drink of your choice. Whether your party is in-person or on Zoom, Sips has you covered.

To begin playing, tap New Game to "shuffle" the deck and let the fun begin. Players will be randomly selected to participate in dares, games, trivia, and so much more.

Sips can be played by whoever, but works best when 3+ people are participating in a single game. Add up to 16 friends!

Can't get enough of Sips? You can email us suggestions straight from the main menu on how we can improve!
