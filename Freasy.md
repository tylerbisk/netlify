Freasy is my second app development project.  For this project, unlike Sips, I am going to have someone help me on the business side of the project so I can better focus on the product development.

Freasy is a social media app designed by college students for college students unlike any other on the market.  It is difficult to use the app without maintaining social distancing so although development has been completed as of August, the app has yet to be released.

The implementation of Freasy is much more involved than that for previous coding assignments.  Freasy, being a social media application, requires backend web development.  I decided to use Firebase Cloud Messaging services for notification handling while writing some simple Javascript code to handle parsing the data.  In order to store data that users voluntarily provide Freasy, I use Cloud Firestore.

Currently, I am using Testflight to allow some of my friends to test the app and work out some bugs.  This page will be updated upon release.
