#### Purchasing forms
[Before you buy stuff form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwajw2Zv9WkyvcYXL_lfrwDfA3sEsFtR9msqH-3IG0GNk5Ww/viewform): this form is to be filled out before you buy *anything* that you want the chapter to reimburse you for.  If you fail to fill out this form or fail to gain approval for your purchase, you are liable for any expenses incurred.

[After you buy stuff form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdX1vd8B7KyBEL41wzLM74NYBpQJ-_CoVQ9_efVvGB4x1sAJw/viewform): this form is so you can upload your receipt after buying stuff with chapter money.  You will then be reimbursed if and only if both forms were filled out **and** you had permission to use chapter funds.
