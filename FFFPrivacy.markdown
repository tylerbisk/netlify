# Free Food Finder Privacy Policy
---
##### This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Free Food Finder on iPhone and any other devices and platforms

**Free Food Finder will hereinafter be referred to as FFF**

---

### Information we collect

FFF has access to names, emails, locations, and food that users enter. However, we do not release those for marketing purposes. We store them for security purposes. We cannot see passwords used for FFF accounts.

### Technical basics

If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.

### Ads and analytics

FFF collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.
No personal data is used to target FFF ads. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.

### Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish an increase in functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

We may disclose your information to universities or colleges that provide sufficient grounds and evidence that necessitates said disclosure. This is to prevent the abuse of FFF’s services, and make sure students are using our services safely and properly.  

### California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### Information for European Union Customers

By using FFF and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

### International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

### Your Consent

By using FFF, you consent to our privacy policy.
