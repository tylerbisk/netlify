Hi, my name is Tyler Bisk.  I am currently a freshman at Cornell University's College of Engineering who is interested in all things technology.  

Alongside my love for exploring the capabilities of computers, I am an avid chef, a member of [Phi Gamma Delta](http://www.phigam.org)'s Kappa Nu chapter, and an Electrical Engineer for [Cornell Racing](http://www.cornellracing.org), in which we completely build an electric formula-style racecar each year and race in [FSAE](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/formula-sae-electric/about)'s competitions.

In order to explore my love for coding outside the classroom, I have built this website using HTML, CSS, and Markdown.  I have also taken on the challenge of iOS app development and have recently published my first game on the app store.  Check that out [here](/sips/)
