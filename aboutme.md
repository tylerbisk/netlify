Hi, my name is Tyler Bisk.  I am currently a sophomore at Cornell University's College of Engineering who is interested in all things technology.  

Alongside my passion for exploring the capabilities of computers, I am an avid chef, filmmaker, and Electrical Engineer for [Cornell Racing](http://www.cornellracing.org), in which we completely build an electric formula-style racecar each year and race in [FSAE](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/formula-sae-electric/about)'s competitions.

In order to explore my love for coding outside the classroom, I built this website using a combination of HTML, CSS, and a Jekyll template with Markdown.  I have also begun iOS app development and recently published my first game on the Apple App Store [here](/sips/).  Currently, I am in the final development stages of releasing my second app, which you can read about [here](/freasy/)
