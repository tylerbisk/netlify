    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ hello and welcome to my site</h1>

</div>
<p>My name is Tyler Bisk and I am a sophomore at Cornell University's College of
    Engineering studying computer science and electrical and computer engineering.
    I created this website in order to showcase the work that I am most proud to call my own and to demonstrate my excitement
    and gravitation towards all things computers that stretches beyond my coursework.
</p>
<p> Due to my love for coding, in addition to the fact that I host my website for free, it was an easy decision to code my website
    myself instead of going for something like Wix or Squarespace - the experience and extra customizability I gain from building it is unmatched.
    I use HTML with a CSS template that I modified to my liking.
</p>
