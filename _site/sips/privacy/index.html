<h3 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h3>

<p>Sips does not have access to any names or custom cards that a player enters.  The app only can access the amount of time spent in the app and any purchases made.</p>

<h3 id="technical-basics">Technical basics</h3>

<p>If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing. Notifications are not currently a feature.</p>

<h3 id="ads-and-analytics">Ads and analytics</h3>

<p>Sips’ app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.</p>

<p>No personal data is used to target Sips’ ads. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.</p>

<h3 id="information-usage">Information usage</h3>

<p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p>

<p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish an increase in functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties.</p>

<p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

<h3 id="california-online-privacy-protection-act-compliance">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>

<p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

<h3 id="childrens-online-privacy-protection-act-compliance">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>
